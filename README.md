🚧 WIP 🚧 : purr starter is a modern Webpack starter kit fueled with a lot of cool stuff.

**Current version:** `0.1.0`

## ☕️ Quick start

1. Clone and install dependencies
```
git clone git@github.com:Manoz/purr-starter.git
cd purr-starter
yarn install
```

2. Run the app
```
yarn start
```

It will start the dev server (browserSync feat webpack).

3. Build everything
```
yarn build
```

It will serve all files in the `/dist` folder and run the tests.

4. Test the app
```
yarn test
```

Here is some commands you can also use instead:

* `yarn clean-dist`: clean the './dist' folder

## 🚎 Technos

This app uses some good technologies:

* Babel
* Browsersync
* ESlint (with the badass airbnb config)
* SASS
* Webpack


## TODO

  * [ ] Maybe add some kind of watcher when adding images in the `./src/assets/images` folder.
  * [ ] Add Jest or Mocha tests
  * [ ] More webpack (or maybe Gulp) tasks to handle fonts or iconfonts
  * [ ] Add CI
  * [ ] Better documentation
